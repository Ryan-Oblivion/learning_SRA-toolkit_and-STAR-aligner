# !/bin/bash

# here i call STAR to take the human genome and the gtf, that was downloaded from the ensembl website,
# and i unzip the human genome and its gtf file to then use as parameters in the code.
# this will allow me to build a reference genome locally, i think.
# which i will then use other STAR commands to align the fastq files, generated in the other script
# called get_fastq_from_runs.txt, to the human genome created here
# 
STAR --runMode genomeGenerate -- genomeDir ref/ --genomeFastaFiles Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna_sm.primary_assembly.fa --sjdbGTFfile Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.108.gtf --runThreadN 16

# note: this ends with an error and i don't know how to fix it yet.
# when i look at the Log.out file it looks like it had no problem generating the genome and there 
# were no errors written in the Log.out file. so maybe it did work?
